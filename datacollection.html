        <h1>DATA</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                The dataset our group chose to analyze, focuses on hate crimes reported by the FBI during the years 1991-2022.
                We will clean the data to specifically analyze the changes in reports made during the years of COVID-19 and the 
                pandemic (2018-2020) which targeted Asian and Asian-American peoples. We are able to access this data in a FBI Open 
                Crime Investigator search engine. To answer our specific question of examining hate crimes experienced by Asians and 
                Asian-Americans, we can specify that in the search engine and the dataset will filter the years, along with the targeted 
                audience.

        <h2>METHODS</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Our group will research our data through methods such as descriptive analysis and regression analysis which will support us in 
                seeing if there is a correlation between a specific variable and our outcomes. Tools we plan to use are R to clean up and identify 
                data from our large dataset, as well as Visual Studio Code where we would code our HTML and CSS based website for a presentation, 
                to upload our website we plan on using Github to upload a public page for viewing. However, if our group decides to do a slideshow 
                instead we will create such using Google Slides and presenting our findings there.
