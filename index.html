            <h1>ABOUT OUR PROJECT</h1>
            <p>Among many fears within the anxious years we have dealt with during 2020 to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we also experienced the fear of hate crime. 
            It became more fearful during these times because it was close to home. At the height of our fears, we feared not only for the safety of our community, 
            we feared the safety of our own family members. Asian hate crime existed even prior to the recent pandemic. However, with the origin of the pandemic and 
            the general fear of catching the virus, the prejudice towards Asians heightened. This had put our lives at stake. With this in mind, our project will deeply 
            analyze these hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically analyzing the motivations for these crimes and numerical statistics of the rise of crimes 
            during the pandemic. There are not many datasets and research that showcase the proper statistics of hate crime during this time. Because of this and our motivation 
            to expose the reality for our communities, we will make these statistics more comprehensive and accessible for all users to view.

            <h2>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</h2>
            <div class="questions">
                <li>How has the prevalence of Asian hate crimes changed compared to previous years before the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
                <li>How does geographical location, including factors such as population, state, and building type, impact the frequency of Asian hate crimes?</li>
                <li>What type of offense is most common against Asians in the United States?</li>

                    Our group could not find datasets specifically about Asian Hate Crimes during Covid or even Asian Hate Crimes in general. However, while researching we 
                    did notice there was a lot of research about Asian Hate during this time from larger and generalized datasets. Much of the previous research came to the same conclusion 
                    that racial prejudice, xenophobia, and stereotypes are the underlying causes of rising Asian Hate since the pandemic. Measures of success will be through comparisons of 
                    the number of hate crimes targeting Asians during the COVID-19 pandemic to the previous years to quantify the surge. Also through identification of hotspots throughout 
                    the country for Asian Hate. Lastly, through the frequency of offenses occurring throughout the time period.
